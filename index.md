## ReproGen

### Background

Across NLP, a growing body of work is looking at the issue of reproducibility. However, replicability of human evaluation experiments and reproducibility of their results is currently under-addressed, and this is of particular concern for NLG where human evaluations are the norm. With the ReproGen shared task on reproducibility of human evaluations in NLG we aim (i) to shed light on the extent to which past NLG evaluations have been replicable and reproducible, and (ii) to draw conclusions regarding how evaluations can be designed and reported to increase reproducibility. If the task is run over several years, we hope to be able to document an overall increase in levels of reproducibility over time.
